This is a .NET Core Web API for listing and booking resources. It's using its own SqlLite database and seeding initial data in development mode. 
To start the project you can use Visual Studio and start using configuration Resources.API. This will start the API listening for HTTPS request on port 5001. 
That's all that should be done to get you started.
